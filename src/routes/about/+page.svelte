	<h1 class="h1">About the project</h1>
	<p>
		The Herbarium of the Botanical Garden of the University of Bern (Herbarium Bernense) is one of
		the five largest herbaria in Switzerland. This collection includes plants, algae and fungi
		either dried or preserved in alcohol. The specimens can last for centuries and represent a
		unique long-term archive of the occurrence, distribution, and diversity of the respective
		organisms.

	<h2 class="h2">Collections of the Herbarium Bernense</h2>
	<ul class="list-disc list-inside">
		<li>
			Herbarium specimens: The largest collection of the Herbarium Bernense are the herbarium
			specimens, pressed and mounted on herbarium sheets. The oldest of the estimated 500,000
			specimens dates back to the year 1753.
		</li>
		<li>
			Wet collection: The wet collection, preserved in an 75% ethanol solution, is probably the
			largest historical wet collection of plants and fungi in Switzerland and comprises 1,142
			specimens.
		</li>
		<li>
			Dry bulk collection: This collection comprises about 3000 specimens of seeds, woody fruits,
			tree cross sections and fungi fruit bodies.
		</li>
		<li>
			Fossil collection: About 3000 specimens of fossilized plants and archaeological finds (e.g.
			fossilised grains from prehistoric pile dwellings) are contained in this collection.
		</li>
		<li>
			Botanical illustrations: Botanical illustrations have the advantage that they can show natural
			colours better than preserved specimens, such as the magnificent water colours of fungi by
			<a class="anchor" href="http://www.botany.unibe.ch/gallery/otth.php">Gustav Otth</a> (1806-1874).
		</li>
		<li>
			Photo collection: Besides slides and photographs, the Herbarium Bernense includes several
			artistically hand-coloured glass plates, including those by Josef Hanel (1865-1940). He
			enjoyed a high reputation as a master of the photographic craft and as a gifted artist.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h2 class="h2">Reconditioning and digitization</h2>
	<p>
		Since 2022, four projects are currently running to recondition and digitize the first 10% of the
		Herbarium Bernense collection. These projects were made possible by the Swiss Network of Natural
		History Collections (<a class="anchor" href="https://swisscollnet.scnat.ch/de">SwissCollNet</a
		>):
